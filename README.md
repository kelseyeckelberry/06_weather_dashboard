# Unit 06 Homework: Weather Dashboard

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Description

I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that  runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It displays weather conditions for any city that the users searches for, and will save recently searched for cities/weather information using `localStorage`. [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was utilized to retrieve weather data for those cities.
